## Pi Number :![Uploading OIG1.3ZKw.jfif…]()

      Pi (often represented by the lower-case Greek letter π), one of the most well-known mathematical constants, is the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter.  For any circle, the distance around the edge is a little more than three times the distance across.
Typing π into a calculator and pressing ENTER will yield the result 3.141592654, not because this value is exact, but because a calculator’s display is often limited to 10 digits.  Pi is actually an irrational number (a decimal with no end and no repeating pattern) that is most often approximated with the decimal 3.14 or the fraction 227.

The definition of π is:
 
 The Circumference  divided by the Diameter of a Circle.

The number pi (π) is a mathematical constant that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. It is approximately equal to 3.14159 and is an irrational number, meaning it cannot be expressed as a fraction and its decimal representation goes on infinitely without repeating.

Pi has been studied for thousands of years and has applications in various fields such as mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science. It is also a fundamental constant in trigonometry and calculus.

## Name :
   The symbol used by mathematicians to represent the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is the lowercase Greek letter π, sometimes spelled out as pi. In English, π is pronounced as "pie" (/paɪ/ PY).In mathematical use, the lowercase letter π is distinguished from its capitalized and enlarged counterpart Π, which denotes a product of a sequence, analogous to how Σ denotes summation.

The choice of the symbol π is discussed in the section Adoption of the symbol π.

## Defenition :
   π is commonly defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference C to its diameter d:



## Where does pi occur? :
   Pi occurs in many areas of mathematics, far too many to list here.

## Methods for calculating pi :
   #1- Gauss Legendre Algorithm :
            
   The Gauss-Legendre algorithm is a method to compute the digits of π. It is based on the individual work of Carl Friedrich Gauss and Adrien-Marie Legendre, 
   combined with modern algorithms for multiplication and square roots. The algorithm repeatedly replaces two numbers by their arithmetic and geometric mean, in        order to approximate their arithmetic-geometric mean. It is notable for being rapidly convergent, with only 25 iterations producing 45 million correct              digits of π. However, it is computer memory-intensive. Successive iterations of the algorithm produce better approximations of the circle constant, π.

   #2- Nilakantha Series : 

   The Nilakantha series is a method for calculating the value of π, named after the Indian mathematician Nilakantha who lived from 1444 to 15441. It is an infinite series that converges towards π1. The series is given by:

      π = 3 + 4 / (2*3*4) – 4 / (4*5*6) + 4 / (6*7*8) – . . .

The pattern of the series involves the multiplication of three consecutive numbers in the denominator and alternating addition and subtraction2. This series continues indefinitely, providing increasingly accurate approximations of π2.

   #3- Leibniz Formula : 

   The Leibniz formula for π, named after Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, is a method for calculating the value of π using an alternating series1. It was first discovered by the Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama in the 14th or 15th century. The formula is given by:

          π=4∑k≥0(−1)k12k+1
